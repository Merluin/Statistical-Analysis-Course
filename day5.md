## 🎁 Predicting Santa’s Gift Delivery
Santa wants to predict how many gifts he can deliver based on the hours of travel time available on Christmas Eve. Over the past 100 years, he collected data on:

- **Travel Hours (continuous)**
- **Gifts Delivered (integer, in millions)**

As the population increases each year, Santa assumes there are **2 billion children**.

**Tasks:**
- Determine the test to use to predict the number of gifts based on travel time.  
- Analyze the data.  
- Restituate briefly the results.

## 🍬 Toys production
The elves are analyzing the efficiency of their toy production. They want to predict the total production of toys (continuous) based on two factors:

1. **Number of elves working in the workshop (continuous)**
2. **Average number of candy canes consumed per elf (continuous)**

**Tasks:**
- Determine the test to evaluate the combined effects of these variables on toy production.  
- Analyze the data.  
- Restituate briefly the results.
