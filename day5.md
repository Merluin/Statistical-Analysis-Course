Example: Predicting Santaâ€™s Gift Delivery
Santa wants to predict how many gifts he can deliver based on the hours of travel time available on Christmas Eve. Over the past 100 years, he collected data on:

Travel Hours (continuous)
Gifts Delivered (in millions)
This year, Santa assumes there are 2 billion children worldwide.

Tasks:
Determine the Test to Use:
Based on the description, identify which statistical test Santa should use to determine if travel time can predict the number of gifts delivered.
Analyze the Data:
Using the data provided in the file Santa_gift.csv, run the appropriate analysis to answer these questions:
Does travel time significantly predict the number of gifts delivered?
If yes, what is the equation of the regression line?
Calculate Time Needed:
Using the regression model, calculate how many hours Santa needs to deliver gifts to 2 billion children this year.
