# üìù **Exercise: Student Grades in Dr. Zeppo's Class**

Dr. Zeppo's students have historically achieved an average grade of **61/100** over several years. The dataset provides a sample of current students, and Dr. Zeppo wants to know if these students perform better than the historical average.

## **Instructions**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check the Data**  
- Summarize the data (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).  
- Visualize the grades using histograms or boxplots to check the distribution.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Write the Hypothesis**

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** The mean grade of the current students is **equal to or less than** the historical mean of 61.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** The mean grade of the current students is **greater than** the historical mean of 61.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Choose the Appropriate Test**

- Based on the data distribution:
  - Use a **one-sample t-test** to compare the mean grade of the current sample to the historical mean.  
  - Check assumptions (e.g., normality) before conducting the test.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Report the Results**

- Include:
  1. **Test statistic** (e.g., t-value).  
  2. **Degrees of freedom (df).**  
  3. **P-value** and whether it is significant.  
  4. **Effect size** (if applicable).  

- Provide a clear interpretation:
  - Does the data support the hypothesis that the current students are performing better?
