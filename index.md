# üéì **Introduction**

Conducting research often involves analyzing data collected through experiments. To support this process, a wide range of software tools is available, providing capabilities for data exploration, statistical analysis, and graphical representation.

Researchers must carefully choose tools that balance **efficiency**, **ease of use**, and **cost**. Two powerful and accessible options for data analysis are **Excel** and **Jamovi**:
- **Excel:** Renowned for its versatility and user-friendly interface.
- **Jamovi:** An open-source platform offering advanced statistical tools, reproducibility features, and integration with R, designed for disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and social sciences.

### **Course Objectives**
This course will introduce participants to data analysis using Excel and Jamovi, covering:
- Exploring datasets.
- Performing statistical analyses.
- Creating visualizations.
- Interpreting results effectively.
