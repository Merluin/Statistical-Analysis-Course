# Introduzione

Conducting research often involves analyzing data collected through experiments. A wide range of software tools is available for this purpose, offering functionalities for data exploration, statistical analysis, and graphical representation.

Researchers must choose tools that best meet their needs, balancing efficiency, ease of use, and cost. Excel and Jamovi are two powerful and accessible options for data analysis. Excel is widely recognized for its versatility and user-friendly interface, while Jamovi is an open-source software that offers an intuitive platform for statistical analysis. Designed for researchers in various disciplines (psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and social sciences), Jamovi provides advanced statistical tools, reproducibility features, and integration with R for flexibility.

This course aims to introduce participants to data analysis using Excel and Jamovi. It will cover essential functionalities, enabling participants to explore data, perform statistical analyses, create visualizations, and interpret results effectively.
